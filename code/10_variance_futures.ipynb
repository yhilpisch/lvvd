    "By introducing variance futures on the EURO STOXX 50 stock index, Eurex standardizes one of the most popular types of volatility/variance derivatives, namely variance swaps. Such a standardization brings a number of benefits to the markets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **unified terms**: standardization leads to unified, well-documentad terms\n",
    "* **transparency**: centralized trading at Eurex increases transparency for all market participants\n",
    "* **liquidity**: standardization and centralization increases liquidity (market depth) in the variance futures\n",
    "* **fungibility**: variance futures are fully fungible and can be traded in and out at any point over their life time\n",
    "* **increased market integrity**: clearing by Eurex ensures, among others, low counterparty risk and high risk management standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance futures replicate the payoff of Over-the-Counter (OTC) variance swaps and are traded based on OTC conventions in vega notional and at volatility strikes. Daily margin payments based on settlement prices add up to the final settlement payoff of the OTC variance swap. Trading start for the variance futures of Eurex has been the 22. September 2014.\n",

    "* discount factor as for the mark-to-market for variance swaps\n",
    "* accumulated return on modified variation margin (ARMVM) for the daily margin payments\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perfectly mimic the cash flow of a variance swap with the same terms, variance futures trading makes certain conversions necessary. This is mainly due to the variance swaps being based on end-of-day returns of the respective index (which cannot be exactly known during the day). Therefore, there are two conversions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **intraday**: intraday trades are booked with the desired quantity and at preliminary futures prices\n",
    "* **end-of-day**: at the end of the day, intraday trades are cancelled and re-booked with the same quantity at the futures settlement prices (taking into account the realized variance for the rest of the day, i.e. since the time the trade was initially booked)\n",
    "\n",
    "All trades are booked and conversions are made by the Eurex T7 trading system. While variance futures are quoted in Vega notional and volatility strikes, bookings and clearings are made only in futures and futures prices. "

    "This chapter deals with the basic notions and concepts that need to be understood to trade Eurex variance futures based on the EURO STOXX 50 stock index. It introduces all concepts in formal fashion and illustrates their calculation based on a concrete numerical example which is based on the same data as the variance swap example calculation in the previous chapter. This makes it possible to numerically show that indeed the construction of the Eurex variance futures contract replicates the payoff of typical OTC variance contracts while adding intraday liquidity and tradeability. The subsequent chapter covers special aspects that relate to the intraday trading and end-of-day settlement of these derivatives products."
